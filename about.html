                        <p style="width: 100%;" >With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All to often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the costumer and end user. </p>
                        <p style="width: 100%;" >For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's goal. The end result is the right product, delivered on time and on budget.</p>
